# Stack
Project about developing Stack clone video game in Unity game engine.

Main goal of this game is to add new tiles on top of previous one. That way tower made of tiles will grow and for every new one player's highscore will be increased by one. The hard part is that every new tile is moving back and forth and player has to react at particular time to fit the new tile as best as he can. The error which player will make will cut that part out.

The game can be played in online and offline mode. If you can't register and login, most likely the server is down. In online mode you have access to achievements that you have done and shop where you can buy things.
